# BEC-Catch-Me-If-You-Can-

Simulated a real-world Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack targeting a corporate network. As part of the Blue Team, I analyzed network traffic (PCAP files) using Wireshark to:

- Identify malicious phishing emails masquerading as legitimate communications.

- Trace the attackerâ€™s infrastructure (IPs, domains, email headers).

- Distinguish between fraudulent vs. legitimate emails to mitigate the threat.
